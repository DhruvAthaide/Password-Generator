Hi, I have created a Password Generator which can generate random passwords using JavaScript Logic.
You can generate Passwords using:
1. Lowercase (a-z)
2. Uppercase (A-Z)
3. Numbers (0-9)
4. Symbols (!-$^+)
5. Exclude Duplicate
6. Include Spaces

You can mess around with the checkboxes to generate a password desirable to the user!
PS: I have only used a bit of code from a video on Youtube.

Thanks for checking out my Repository!
